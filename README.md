## How to Play

## Requirements to Run the Game
You need Python3 to run this application on your system.

If you have the NumPy library then you are all set, otherwise, I have set up a virtual environment for you with NumPy library installed already.

## How to Run (If you don't have NumpPy installed): 
- On your terminal, after you are inside '\application', you need to activate the virtual environment.
- To activate the virtual environment, write ' \env\Scripts\activate ' on your terminal.
- There should now be " (env) " written on the left most side of your terminal, indicating that the environment is now active.
- Now, you should be able to run the program after going inside \application\ui using the command ' py console2048.py '


## PHASE 1 DONE 
- (include example in explaination)

## PHASE 2 is GUI using python
