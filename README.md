# 2048-game
### What is the Game?
2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
## Additional Features
My version of 2048 is developed such that:
- The board could be made for N x N, by changing the number in '\application\model\constant'
- The probability of giving out *twos* after each move can be changed by changing the number in '\application\model\constant'

## How to Play

## Requirements to Run the Game
You need Python3 to run this application on your system.

If you have the NumPy library then you are all set, otherwise, I have set up a virtual environment for you with NumPy library installed already.

## How to Run (If you don't have NumpPy installed): 
- On your terminal, after you are inside '\application', you need to activate the virtual environment.
- To activate the virtual environment, write ' \env\Scripts\activate ' on your terminal.
- There should now be " (env) " written on the left most side of your terminal, indicating that the environment is now active.
- Now, you should be able to run the program after going inside \application\ui using the command ' py console2048.py '


## PHASES
- **Phase 1** : Developing a console-based version of 2048 using python
- **Phase 2** : Developing a Graphical User Interface version of 2048 using python
  
****Current Status: Phase 2 in progress***
